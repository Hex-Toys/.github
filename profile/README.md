# Welcome 👋
Welcome to the Hex Toys Organization! We're a diverse and dynamic team of technology enthusiasts, innovators, and digital art connoisseurs, committed to expanding the horizons of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

## 🙋‍♀️ About Us
Despite our name, Hex Toys doesn't deal with conventional 'toys'. Instead, we're redefining the concept of play in the digital age. We are proud to pioneer a unique marketplace for Hex and PulseChain collectibles, providing a platform for users to dive into the world of DeFi and NFTs.

Our mission is to facilitate users in listing their digital artwork, collecting exclusive digital collectibles, and gaining access to our premium rewards club. We envision a world where digital creativity and financial innovation intersect, and we strive to create that through our platform.

## 🌈 How to Contribute
While our repositories remain private to ensure the secure and smooth operation of our services, we maintain a strong bond with our community. The spirit of collaboration and open discussion underpins our approach.

We provide public access to our contracts, audits & comprehensive documentation, ensuring complete transparency in our operations. Feel free to explore our Public Documentation and Audits to get a better grasp of our platform.

## 👩‍💻 Our Roadmap
The future is exciting at Hex Toys. We have an extensive roadmap for development, introducing a range of innovative features never seen before in the DeFi space. Our upcoming initiatives will further enrich the user experience, providing more immersive and lucrative opportunities for our community. For a glimpse into our future plans, keep an eye on our Roadmap & make sure you check out the Discussions area to request new features and ask question.
